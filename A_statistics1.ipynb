        "## 1. Explain the properties of the F-distribution.\n",
        "The F-distribution is a continuous probability distribution that arises frequently in variance analysis. It has the following properties:\n",
        "- It is positively skewed and only takes positive values.\n",
        "- It is defined by two degrees of freedom parameters (df1, df2).\n",
        "- The mean of the F-distribution is approximately **df2 / (df2 - 2)** for df2 > 2.\n",
        "- As the degrees of freedom increase, the F-distribution approximates the normal distribution.\n",
        "- It is commonly used in hypothesis testing, such as ANOVA and variance ratio tests.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. In which types of statistical tests is the F-distribution used, and why is it appropriate for these tests?\n",
        "The F-distribution is primarily used in:\n",
        "- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: To compare means of multiple groups by analyzing variance.\n",
        "- **F-test for Equality of Variances**: To compare variances of two populations.\n",
        "- **Regression Analysis**: To determine the significance of regression models.\n",
        "It is appropriate for these tests because it models the ratio of variances, which helps in determining if observed differences are statistically significant.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. What are the key assumptions required for conducting an F-test to compare the variances of two populations?\n",
        "To perform an F-test, the following assumptions must be met:\n",
        "- The samples are **independent** of each other.\n",
        "- The data is **normally distributed** in both populations.\n",
        "- The samples are drawn **randomly** from their respective populations.\n",
        "- The populations have **equal variances**, unless testing for variance equality.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. What is the purpose of ANOVA, and how does it differ from a t-test?\n",
        "ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is used to compare **more than two group means** to determine if at least one group significantly differs. A t-test, on the other hand, is used for comparing the means of **only two groups**. The key difference:\n",
        "- **t-test**: Compares two groups' means.\n",
        "- **ANOVA**: Compares multiple groups' means simultaneously, reducing Type I error.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. Explain when and why you would use a one-way ANOVA instead of multiple t-tests when comparing more than two groups.\n",
        "A one-way ANOVA is preferred over multiple t-tests because:\n",
        "- **Prevents Type I error inflation**: Running multiple t-tests increases the likelihood of false positives.\n",
        "- **More efficient**: ANOVA tests all group differences in one test.\n",
        "- **More statistical power**: Detects group differences better than separate t-tests.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6. Explain how variance is partitioned in ANOVA into between-group variance and within-group variance. How does this partitioning contribute to the calculation of the F-statistic?\n",
        "- **Between-group variance**: Variability due to differences between group means.\n",
        "- **Within-group variance**: Variability within each group due to random error.\n",
        "- **F-statistic Calculation**:\n",
        "  \\[ F = \\frac{\\text{Between-group variance}}{\\text{Within-group variance}} \\]\n",
        "A high F-value suggests significant differences among groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 7. Compare the classical (frequentist) approach to ANOVA with the Bayesian approach. What are the key differences in terms of how they handle uncertainty, parameter estimation, and hypothesis testing?\n",
        "| Aspect | Classical ANOVA | Bayesian ANOVA |\n",
        "|--------|----------------|----------------|\n",
        "| **Uncertainty** | Uses p-values to determine significance | Uses probability distributions |\n",
        "| **Parameter Estimation** | Estimates mean differences using sample data | Uses prior distributions and updates beliefs |\n",
        "| **Hypothesis Testing** | Null hypothesis rejection based on p-value | Probability of model correctness based on prior and posterior beliefs |\n",
